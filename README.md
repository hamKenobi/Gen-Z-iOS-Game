Description
------
Gen-Z is an incredibly fun video game app that is similar to Space Invaders/Galaga. Instead of having a spaceship, we will have a character with a weapon (guns, melee weapons, and magic). From top to bottom, the player will encounter hordes of enemies, such as zombies or monsters...IN SPACE! You will be able to choose the appearance of your character and the class, each of which having different attributes. We are going to have four different views. For the first view, it will be the start menu view. For the second view, it will be the pick your character name and class view. For the third view, it will be the actual game view. The fourth and last view will be the high score and upload to Facebook/Instagram view. For the external API, we will have Bluetooth controller and Gesture capabilities. We will use an iPhone as a physical hardware device to test the Bluetooth controller. We will need the Core Data, Gesture, Networking, Core Graphics, and import Sprite Kit frameworks/libraries for our app. We will also need Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to design the graphics for our app. We will have different open-source video game audio tracks playing in the background for different events (boss battle, special round) of our app. We will make our app work for multiple screen sizes, ranging from iPhones of all sizes to iPads of all sizes. May Include additional features depending on time.

Instructions
------
To play the game, click PLAY on the main menu, enter your name and choose your chip. Every ship you kill gives you 5 points. Hitting another ship and killing your main ship still gives you 5 points, but you will die. You can pause the game at any time by clicking the pause button at the top right corner of the game screen. You can also fire by clicking the fire button at the bottom right corner of the game screen. You can also physically move left and right using the left and right buttons at the bottom left of the game screen. After you complete your game, your score will be uploaded the High Scores Menu that is ordered by score from highest to lowest with the correct name associated with each score, the names are initialized to 10 random name values at the very start of the game, and it will automatically fill in a Twitter handler to post your score to Twitter. 
	To read the story behind the game, click STORY on the main menu.

We hope you enjoy the game as much as we did making it! â€“ The Gen-Z Team
